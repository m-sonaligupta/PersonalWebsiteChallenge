          <h3>Design & Development</h3>
          <p>I started coding from the age of 16 but realised i was too bad at it as I didn't find anyone to guide me well. Even after enrolling into the course for professional degree it was hard to gain knowledge and have hands on skills. But now in 2020 I find it soo comfortable to have choosen this field as theres always something new to learn. </p>

          <h3>Hot Wings Challenge</h3>
          <p>Though I believe competitions help to improve your skills but i find giving self time and researching on topics is more powerful and knowledgeable. It is best to always explore yourself, you may never know when you can surprise your own self.</p>
